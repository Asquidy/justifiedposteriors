 I went to Duke and everyone at Duke cares about basketball.
 So imagine you're the one person that doesn't really enjoy sports.
 The fact that the basketball team is there and is very good is a huge
 negative for you and you play for everyone to no longer go to the basketball game.
 So I think the problem is that there any social activity is going to draw
 in people who'd rather be doing some other social activity or sometimes
 a non-social activity at all. Yeah, so think of a kind of the battle of the
 sex is framing where there's a population that likes social media and a
 population that doesn't like social media, but we all have to coordinate.
 Right. And, you know, sure, you want to fight on this about the social
 equilibrium, but don't frame this as an economic story.
 Don't frame this as a we're losing efficiency.
 Frame it as what it is, which is I prefer a culture that looks like this.
 And that applies, of course, to so many parts of culture, right?
 And this is what the culture wars are about.
 This is justified posteriors brought to you by the Digital Business Institute
 at Boston University's Questrum School of Business.
 I'll connect everyone to another episode of the Justified Pastereors
 podcast where we read economics papers and get persuaded by them.
 So you don't have to.
 I'm Seth Benzel coming to you from the Hotel California
 like a collective trap of Southern California.
 And I'm Andre Fratkin representing the no FOMO movement that I'd like to
 propagate throughout society.
 That's a great place to start, Andre.
 Do you come and experience FOMO?
 Is that an is that an emotion that you have?
 So FOMO or the fear of missing out for the neophytes listening to this
 podcast is a common feeling.
 You'll fight means it doesn't know it's low means.
 You make too many assumptions about our audience, Seth.
 But anyway, do I feel FOMO?
 I do feel FOMO.
 I feel like not as much as maybe I used to, but I definitely see people doing stuff.
 And I'm like, I'd rather be doing that than whatever it is I'm currently doing.
 I definitely experienced that emotion.
 How about you?
 Great question.
 I would say FOMO, Qua FOMO, in the sense of I don't necessarily want to go to
 this party, but I am jealous, anxious about not, but experiencing some sort of
 anxiety over the fact that I am not at the party, but the fact that I might not
 even want to be at the party.
 So that's kind of common to me.
 And I would say I'm kind of sympathetic to the view that if you show a photo
 of a bunch of people in my high school class, a bunch of people in my freshman
 dorm, you know, smiling and bonding with each other while, you know, I'm in my
 solo dorm by myself, I think FOMO is a real emotion that I've experienced.
 And I would say that there's even a possibility that social media accelerates
 that and makes it more vivid.
 Now, this is a bit off topic on the college, FOMO.
 But when you say party, do you mean conference?
 When I say party, I don't mean conference.
 What I have in mind is your typical stank drinking party.
 And you can see someone preferring to live in a world where there's less
 social pressure to deal with that.
 They're the cultural critique of social media, which is that it pushes us to do
 showy superficial things, because that's where the pressure is.
 Maybe we're trapped performing for each other in a glass menagerie.
 Well, as John Paul Sartre once said, hell is other people.
 So, you know, this paper definitely takes that idea seriously.
 What's the title of the paper?
 The title of the paper is when product markets become collective traps, the
 case of social media.
 This is a paper by Leonardo Bertson, Benjamin Handel, Rafael Jimenez, and
 Christopher Ross for the non-economists listening to this.
 This is quite an accomplished author team.
 They're definitely known for their careful experimental work and innovative
 work in general.
 And this is a paper that has had a lot of, let's say, media attention and just overall
 and so it's got a newsy hypothesis.
 Yes, yes.
 I had the opportunity to meet with Rafael Jimenez and Biconi just last week.
 Could not meet a more gracious open to criticism of his work guy.
 So, Rafael, if you're listening to this, any criticisms of this paper come from a
 place of critiquing only your audacity and boldness and actually putting these
 ideas out there.
 Yes.
 So that's a great intro.
 So what are the main claims of the paper?
 Maybe we should state those before we get to the evidence and presumably we'll
 state our priors after we state the podcast, the sort of the narrow claim of the
 paper and then maybe we'll expand out from there.
 The narrow claim of the paper is that users of TikTok and Instagram, US college
 campuses are in a collective trap in the sense that they all prefer to use the
 platform given that everyone in their community is using the platform, but they
 would prefer to live in a world where no one used the platform at all.
 And I would say the paper both talks about this in a sort of average person
 sense most of the time, but you could also see a version of this argument about
 the median person instead of the average person.
 What's your hypothesis?
 Do you do you buy that at all?
 How do you evaluate that going in?
 I think it's a pretty reasonable hypothesis.
 Lots of aspects of society seem to suffer from this.
 The rat race, the red queen effect, and so on, where people feel compelled to
 invest in something long past its actual utility to them.
 It doesn't seem crazy to me that this could be an example of that.
 You can think of other examples such as trying to be fashionable or even trying
 to be well read.
 Oh, yeah, but that's a rat race.
 I mean, OK, well, maybe we have to start and take a step back and there are
 positive sub rat races and then there are negative sub rat races, right?
 So good.
 So, you know, capitalism itself, right, is a rat race.
 So companies are very actively competing with each other.
 And maybe if they all sat together in a room, they might decide that competing
 so intensely is not a great idea.
 What do you want to do?
 That's that's illegal for perhaps the force of competition or harness for a
 greater purpose, which is promoting the productivity of the economy and increasing
 innovation, hopefully.
 So we have a theory of why competition might be very intense in that setting
 and social media.
 Maybe it's we're all competing to take the coolest photo to
 Instagram or to pretend we look as hot as we possibly could, even though in
 reality, we don't look as hot, whatever it is.
 And you never do that.
 We were never lie to you listeners.
 The only thing that we'll lie to you about is how wonderful our voice
 naturally sounds, you know, because we're going to post edit this to make it sound better.
 Yeah, a lot more in the raw version.
 OK, so what do you think, Seth?
 I think that even though the paper does not focus on this distinction, I think
 there's a massive difference between the hypothesis that the median or a large
 percent group of people are made worse off and the hypothesis that the average
 person is made worse off.
 If we're really trying to take a step back and think about all of the positives
 and all of the benefits from social media, it's clear that there are
 some people who have extremely compelling, powerful social media profiles that
 teach people that distribute information, that entertain, that educate and can
 make giant profits for themselves.
 A full analysis of these platforms would also take into account the profits of
 platforms themselves, the benefits of people getting matched to products with
 advertisements or any of those individuals, you might question every element
 there, you know, to what extent is that a huge social positive?
 I think you add them all together, taking into account this long tail of
 people who really benefit for the platform.
 It's very implausible to me that the average person is made worse off by these
 platforms now.
 And that's sort of like some sort of caldorhic sufficiency sense.
 I think that platform or caldorhic sufficient.
 You know, if you want to tell me that 20% of people are sadder that they, you
 know, they're 10, 20% of people are made 5% more miserable because of Facebook or
 maybe even 40% of people are made 10% more miserable because of Facebook.
 That's a hypothesis that I'm open to.
 It's not the kind of argument that makes me want to slow down modernity and, you
 know, return capital V.
 But I do think there are certainly losers in the new equilibrium.
 There are people who would have been better off without the platform.
 Yeah, and I guess, you know, we'll get to the methodology, but it's also
 important to think about not just at the binary of turning on or off the platform,
 but changing the rules of the platform, right?
 So oftentimes what's bundled in this evaluation of these platforms is maybe
 they're addicting if people are able to have caps or caps imposed on the amount
 of usage that could kind of preserve, it could have kind of yield a much more
 unambiguous benefit of a platform versus one in which a non-negligible share
 of people are completely addicted to it.
 Right.
 So this is a little bit of a false dilemma.
 So you can imagine them asking the follow-up question, how much would you be
 willing to pay Mark Zuckerberg to make the beautiful utopian version of Facebook
 that isn't addictive, makes everyone love each other.
 And maybe you could solicit a big value from that, but we're getting a little
 bit ahead of ourselves because we haven't talked about that paper's methodology yet.
 Talk about the methodology.
 Just get started.
 I think I think the thought experiment that the authors are posing is one where
 you're kind of stuck asking people what they think, right?
 You can't wave your magic wand and actually make it so so that everyone
 stops using TikTok, right?
 So we're asking people hypothetical questions.
 Kind of is maybe the right word here as credible as possible, credible as possible.
 So this is kind of this finesse that the authors try to do.
 Let's start with the simplest case because this is a case that's been done
 previously in literature as well as, you know, we want to know for a person,
 how much do they value a particular online service?
 So the simplest thing you could do is you can ask them, well, how much would we need
 to pay you so that you don't use the service for some amount of time?
 That's a simple thing to ask.
 And oftentimes you get very reasonable answers there, but a worry with that is,
 of course, that you might not, you know, believe that this is a real choice you're
 making, who's going to enforce the fact that you're not going to use this
 particular platform.
 So a subset of experiments in the literature, what they've done is they've
 actually enforced this.
 So if you say you're going to accept, you know, 20 bucks not to use Facebook for
 a month, the authors like literally shut you out of your own Facebook account.
 So you can't do that.
 That's kind of what are the main approaches in the literature about this
 individual decision to use a particular product or service or platform.
 That is, you know, that's kind of, I'd say, not maybe not a solved problem,
 but there's definitely a way that people do it that is more or less accepted.
 What the authors of this paper point out very, very correctly, and also Seth
 has a paper on this topic.
 So I can't disregard his his contributions, but that, of course,
 there isn't just one value from how much Facebook is valuable to you.
 Depends on how many other people you interact with also use Facebook.
 And so what the authors do, kind of the second step of what the authors do here,
 in addition to what I just mentioned, where they ask people how much they'd be
 willing to accept to not use Tiktok and Instagrams.
 They ask, they say, well, we're these really wealthy researchers.
 And there's, there's a chance that we could recruit everyone on your
 campus to turn off this platform.
 And suppose we did this.
 How much would we have to pay you to not use the platform?
 OK, so that's what the authors do.
 Now, this is essentially getting at the difference in valuation for this
 person from the platform with and without their classmates on a college campus.
 And that difference, presumably, is capturing the network effect.
 This is the famous network effect that's so important in social media platforms.
 Get that from the other students on the college campus.
 Yes, yes.
 And that is very important.
 Of course, the social network is not just about the college campus.
 It's a global social network, right?
 There are people like your family and friends who don't go to the same
 college as you who you might be communicating with on on set platform as well.
 Or entertaining third parties.
 Yes, like ourselves.
 We love it when you guys connect to us.
 Do second parties at best?
 Yes.
 And if you do really want us to make a Tiktok account, please submit.
 Please tweet hashtag it.
 Justify past your year's Tiktok when 2025.
 Yes, OK, clearly we are trapped in this collective social media trap.
 I want to add a couple of details to what you just said.
 The first is the sample size we're talking about isn't enormous here.
 It's about a thousand people and a little over a thousand people total.
 And we're going to split into three samples because we're asked some about Instagram.
 We're asked some about Tiktok and there's a subset of the Instagram.
 Those interviewed about Instagram who do not even use Instagram.
 So it's not a giant population.
 And so we're getting split up.
 If they are all college students, the survey population is overwhelmingly
 female, 68% female.
 And so take that into account a little bit.
 We do think there is some evidence that women are particularly susceptible to the
 native social effects of social media.
 We saw that from the famous Instagram leaks, which vaguely hinting at a connection
 between teen girls and suicidality.
 So yeah, so maybe you think that this is a population that's really proud.
 This is they did this survey right as negatives of social media are in the news.
 You might imagine that's in the air as they're taking this survey.
 Are there any other considerations you want to bring in Andre before we
 evaluate the numbers again?
 Well, I haven't mentioned, of course, that there's a kind of a third innovation
 of course, addition to just asking about the network effects, which is they give
 a person the following hypothetical.
 They want to kind of put them in a position of making a decision, whether
 having Instagram or TikTok on a campus is overall good or bad.
 So what they do is they say that with some probability, we're going to pick a
 person and that person could be you and we are going to ask them, should we, should
 we turn off TikTok for the entire campus or not?
 And why this is important is it allows the researchers to then measure kind of how
 much would a person that not having anyone on campus in addition to themselves, you
 know, have access to this platform.
 Right.
 So that's getting, that's the key at getting at the trap.
 Yeah, it's, it's framing it as kind of like the Kickstarter problem is how I would
 think about it, right?
 It says, would you be willing to pay $50 if enough of your friends signed up for
 this $50 plan, right?
 And even though ingenious, if someone believed it at soliciting the correct
 information, what it has to imagine that this is not a very few people taking the
 survey or taking that question literally.
 Yes, although the authors say that, you know, when they asked whether the
 participants believe what they just told them, 40% of them said, yes, well, I believe
 the claim, the thing is the claim is for a case that's impossible.
 No, no, they said that, like, you know, 40% of the people believe that this would
 actually have.
 Oh, wow.
 Incredible.
 I mean, that's some flaws.
 You know, there makes me trust this nevertheless.
 Yeah.
 So
 I think we're going to shut down.
 I, I, you know, let me, let me do a quick look up what specifically that 40% is.
 While you look at it, I'll also add that they also ask questions just of the form.
 You know, do you see social media as bad for your campus?
 And people say yes to that, right?
 So
 there's even if you don't believe the numbers, there are large groups of people
 reporting that they do not like social media.
 Yes.
 So before we discuss the methodology a bit more, I mean, maybe now is a good
 time to introduce the actual numbers.
 Okay, cool.
 So what do they find looking at TikTok first?
 They find that the average person in their sample would be willing to pay $55 to keep
 using TikTok, then they say that if they were the only people on campus using TikTok,
 they would value it at $39.
 And then finally, they believe that they would be willing to pay $24 on average for
 no one on campus to use TikTok, including themselves.
 So dramatic numbers, people in a universe where everyone else uses TikTok, they
 value it at $55 in a universe where nobody else on if everyone on campus were to stop
 using TikTok, they would be happy $24.
 So indicative of perhaps a $70 negative social externality of TikTok use on TikTok,
 they would give social externality of TikTok use on other people on Instagram.
 Those numbers are a little bit smaller, but in the same direction, people valued
 Instagram at $47 a month on average in a case where only they on campus were able
 to use Instagram, they would value it at $37 a month.
 And finally, the amount that they would be willing to pay on average for no one on
 campus to use Instagram is $6 a month.
 So directionally consistent with these theories of a trap, really, it's just
 the last number that tells you what's a trap, the other numbers don't directly
 speak to that question.
 Yes.
 And it's important to note that they also ask people who are not current
 users of the platform.
 OK, so maybe let's talk about these numbers.
 I think one important detail I'd like to add before we get too deep into it.
 I think I might have admitted this from the previous discussion, which is when you
 solicit these valuations, there's kind of two ways you can do it.
 One way you can do it is you can say, give me a number, any number.
 And another, so like basically free response, you know, how much do you value
 Facebook go?
 I don't know, $55.
 Another way you can do it is as a series of yes, no questions.
 Would you give up TikTok for $30?
 Would you give up TikTok for $45?
 They take the second approach.
 So they randomly select some of these yes, no valuations to ask about.
 But importantly, that means that there is a maximum valuation sort of built into
 this.
 TikTok can only be so good because they're not asking, do you value TikTok
 at $1,000, $10,000?
 Similarly, in the negative direction, there is a negative cap for the final question.
 So as you think about these average numbers, I would encourage the readers
 to take into account that if you think there is a long tail of people who benefit
 a lot, we value the platform a greater than $200 that is not being picked up in this.
 Yeah.
 And certainly the authors make some alternative assumptions about those gap numbers.
 And right.
 And I do think an interesting aspect of it is for those who value it at $200,
 maybe they value it so much because of a network effect that's very different
 than the people who value it at $5.
 So like think about being, you know, a power user of Twitter who follows, you know,
 a selected, you know, sample of some of the best researchers in the world versus
 someone who is just getting, you know, the four you feed of a bunch of random
 famous people, a completely different story, right?
 So kind of the various aspects of this may be heterogeneous across users.
 I understand what it is.
 Yes.
 I think if you were to ask me how much do I believe these numbers on their face,
 I think that positive valuations, I think those numbers are.
 If we're thinking about those as averages, I would think those are
 underestimates. I think if you look at conditional, I'm using TikTok,
 how many hours a day people use TikTok.
 Over $55 is very plausible for those power users.
 The intermediate case, how much do you value the platform when no one on your
 campus is using the platform?
 One thing I find kind of pretty implausible here is that there is a bigger drop off
 from losing access to your on-campus friends in TikTok than on Instagram.
 The reason I think that is because when I think about the kinds of connections
 that people value on Instagram, sure, it's international celebrities.
 But it's also people in my family who I want to keep up with, you know,
 pictures of their don.
 Whereas for TikTok, you have to imagine that most of the content being consumed
 is from professional creators.
 But I think you're going to disagree with me on this, Andre.
 Am I completely misunderstanding these platforms?
 I think the network effects on two platforms are different.
 On TikTok, it's not really about messaging between your friends on the same campus.
 It's more like, here's a really funny video that everyone is talking about,
 and I want to see it too.
 And on Instagram, it is really about the sharing aspect of it.
 You really want that like from your friends, this photo you posted,
 or you want your friends to see the story that you posted,
 that you went to some cool place and vice versa.
 So there's just, and that kind of leads us to think about what the collective traps might be,
 right? So the collective trap on TikTok is like,
 you know, oh God, everyone's watching these dumb videos,
 but I have to be in the loop on them because I want to, you know,
 appear like a normal person.
 And on Instagram, it's like, you know, you're, you're kind of keeping track
 of your, of your buddy's idealized lives, you know?
 So yeah, I mean, it's interesting.
 I wouldn't say the strongest prior about these valuations.
 I think both platforms are certainly very useful even without classmates using it.
 Okay, cool.
 Now, how about this, the negative direction?
 So the social cost of using that platform?
 If we think that what's driving this is kind of the FOMO,
 I'm missing the party.
 That's the kind of FOMO I empathize with.
 That would make me think that Instagram would be the bigger trap
 and TikTok would be the smaller trap.
 And yet we have a much bigger trap estimate for TikTok at $24 versus $6 of loss.
 How do you think that?
 I think a lot fewer people use Instagram.
 I mean, this is constantly evolving, of course, and is winning.
 But I think at the time the study, I'd say TikTok was way more important.
 TikTok was in the ascendant.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 So, so just do naive measures of, you know, our spend and stuff.
 It's just a lot more.
 So if you think there's a product market trap, then it will be bigger for that.
 Okay.
 So that you just, the way you interpret these numbers is that just the magnitudes
 for TikTok are larger because people are using it more.
 And the network effects are kind of heterogeneous.
 We can't exaggerate, speculate about what that should be worse.
 Yeah.
 But I guess I want to kind of shift the discussion here.
 A little bit about like, how will the people understand these decisions to begin with?
 Right.
 This is a very hypothetical question.
 Right.
 Hard, hypothetical.
 Let's say all your friends stopped using TikTok.
 What would they be doing instead?
 Okay.
 So one thing they could be doing instead is watching YouTube.
 Now the authors say, you know, they point to, to a previous study that says,
 actually, when you shut off, you know, access to a platform, most people, you know,
 or most of that time allocated is shifted to non-digital activity.
 Sure.
 Short term, you pull a real live term equal.
 Yeah.
 I don't know.
 That's a fresh last destiny.
 So I guess my sense is that you really have to have in mind,
 what are people going to do instead?
 Now, then there's a version where what people are doing instead is they're going to, you know,
 go hang out with each other in person a lot more often or they can play intramural sports
 or hanging out at the bar or whatever, or they could be using another digital platform
 that may or may not be, you know, close compliment to TikTok and Instagram.
 Depending on what you think will happen, that should really affect your valuation.
 Right. Right. Inside this $24 number is a lot and especially the 39th.
 So I think it's easier for people to think about everybody stopping than everybody else stops.
 I use it, which is such a bizarre case, like literally you're imagining becoming a social exile.
 Well, I think, I think it's kind of the vice versa.
 Just, you know, the authors of this paper, they say, maybe you're going to be like an
 information gatekeeper. You're going to be so cool because you're the only one who gets to
 view the TikTok videos first and share them with your friends, you know.
 Like, you know, and then I guess it's a cool result that is a smaller number, right?
 Yeah. But you see how like that origin, the idea of there being sort of like
 decreasing returns to having the platform as more people have the platform, right? That's
 something that should kind of push us, I guess, is that consistent with the trap?
 I think it would push us towards that intermediate. Yeah. I mean, the hypothesis would be that this
 intermediate case would be larger. It's a bizarre, you know, it's a network effect and it would be
 on people not using it. I guess that's very consistent with a collective trap. Yeah, it is.
 Yeah. I think I think the story in the paper is very coherent, right? That what the story
 that they're trying to tell. We don't believe this necessarily. We have to attack the methodology,
 the hypothetical questions or the sample or things like that. Right. And so maybe let's talk a little
 bit more about the sample. I already mentioned it was female dominant. We think it's college
 student. Do you think maybe college students would be particularly susceptible to these
 negative vibes, perhaps? Yeah. Yeah. I think there would be. But but at the same time, I think
 everyone, you know, we're social creatures. So I think different versions of this apply to different
 people. I always think about, does the outside option have its own collective trap, right? So,
 let's say we'd all be doing methods. So imagine you're the one person that doesn't really enjoy
 sports. The fact that the basketball team is there and is very good is a huge negative for you.
 Right. Exactly. For everyone to to to no longer go to. So I think the problem is that there
 any social activity is going to draw in people who'd rather be doing some other social activity
 or sometimes on social activity at all. So are we just learning learning something about
 social behavior more broadly, just that there's a lot of people that if there was no party,
 they'd be happy, but they have to go to the party, right? Yeah, I like this. Right. So think of a
 kind of the battle of the sex is framing where there's a population that likes social media and
 a population that doesn't like social media, but we all have to coordinate, right? And it's
 not a collective trap. It's just that, well, you're the group that had to go to the the musical
 instead of going to the boxing batch. And you know, sure, you want to fight on this about the social
 equilibrium, but don't frame this as an economic story. Don't frame this as a we're losing efficiency,
 frame it as what it is, which is I prefer a culture that looks like this.
 And this is what the culture wars are about. Should people get married early or not?
 Should we make one type of career prestigious or another? All these things are similar types of
 debates. And some of this sometimes the answer may just be that they're incommensurable, right?
 Imagine if you actually thought that life with TikTok was incommensurable with life without TikTok,
 which I mean, maybe, right? Then you're just kind of wildly flailing with these numbers.
 Yeah. And I guess the other thing I should really, like I come back to is the issue of addiction,
 you know, and how well people understand their own addictions, two things, this, you know,
 this might point to a fact that like, you know, if you ask, you know, people what they want to do,
 they want to exercise every day, they want to, you know, they want to meditate and sleep well,
 and so on. But then when they make their choices every day, they don't always, you know, make good
 choices there that might be addicted to social media or video games or browsing the internet or
 whatever. If you ask them like, oh, like, if you just got rid of this thing that you're addicted to,
 you know, would you want that? And you say, yeah, yeah, I want that. But but actually,
 you know, you, you just get addicted to something else. Yeah.
 When we evaluate this, should we take the person who just wants one more TikTok video and their
 amazing, intense desire for that? Is that the true self that we should be taking into account
 in our economic analysis, or rather the cold headed, sitting in a lab trying to think like a
 professional survey taker, you know, trying to have a theory of mind of this survey taker as I take
 a survey version of myself. I mean, that said, I think that it's important to put the study
 into context, right? So we have this broader discussion about laws, for example, laws controlling
 how much teenagers are allowed to use social media. Yeah, in Australia, we just had.
 Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. I was just going to say Australia has passed the law. Apparently,
 within the next year, we're going to have a complete ban on under 16 use of social media.
 Yeah, and individual schools are certainly banning phones or banning social media usage.
 And there's this movement led by Jonathan Haidt that kind of blames a lot of society's
 ills on social media. So it's not just this paper that is kind of pointing to something
 negative about social media. But I let's talk about the political economy here for a second.
 Sure. I think the groups like, what are the groups that are ending up being restricted?
 It's the groups that don't have vote, right? If you really thought that this was a trap,
 and the only thing we need to fix the trap is get a majority of voters to ban it. Why can't we
 get a majority of college? Why can't we get a majority of the population to the man, right?
 And so I guess that's my question. Why don't we keep on if this is popular, why don't we ban it
 than the people who felt instead of people who felt that? Well, I think the answer might be your
 standard answer is that, yeah, you know, a bunch of people might weakly prefer to not have social
 media around. But the people who benefit from social media are really, really benefiting from
 it. And you know, that includes a lot of constituents, of course, right? That includes people who we
 think might be benefiting it for the wrong reasons. People who are just spreading bad ideas or harmful
 content, it might include people who are spreading good ideas that they think are valuable for the
 world. It might include also various businesses, right? So advertising, I guess this is a question
 about how we feel about advertising. But if you think that, you know, giving people information
 about products is something society should be doing, then maybe that's a good thing.
 Right. Yeah. So we return to this idea that there are definitely benefits, but we're definitely
 think that it's plausible that a big percentage of the population prefers a world without it.
 And I think that where that leaves me is just kind of anticipating this populist versus elite
 politics about it, right, is that there'll be the school arm keep this away from me and my family
 faction. And then there'll be the tech elites telling us, no, it's all good. Just keep by logging
 it. I am maybe more sympathetic to the latter view than the ominous way that I just presented it.
 But I think that's going to be the politics for this for the foreseeable future.
 I think populist benefit extraordinary amounts from social media, right? Oh, that's a fair play.
 That they might talk a big game about how they don't like the specific people running specific
 social media companies, but they want those social media. Social media is great for populist.
 Right. But you can imagine the populist deciding on the one platform that's okay,
 right? Then all the other ones. Yes. TikTok is a different case. TikTok is about national security.
 I really think it has very little to do with addiction. All right. So given that the leading
 proposal is to sell off TikTok to an American company, I just don't. I think we're a little
 mixing. Mixing metaphors there. Sell it to Americans if they'll make it more addictive. Yes. All right.
 So I think that brings us to our posterior Andre. To what extent did this paper move your view about
 whether I guess narrowly TikTok and Instagram or traps on college campuses and we're broadly
 whether in general they're a net negative for society. I'm surprised by how many people
 said they would prefer a world without it. I think that to me was a bigger number than I expected.
 And so that didn't move my beliefs. But at the same time, I don't love how hypothetical this
 choices. And I'm also worried just about the respondents kind of catering to what they believe
 the desires of the experiment. They're clearly trying to point in this direction.
 Right. Yeah. But I think it's a very neat study. And I think we shouldn't throw out the data just
 because there might be some issues with how to interpret it. Agree with you that the number
 and the value people are willing to put on these sorts of banning social media outcomes. I did find
 surprising and does move my view about maybe how the for rearing people from benefits most from
 Instagram to is hard the most from Instagram. Like maybe in my brain traveling up the percentiles
 that are being made worse off. Maybe going into this, I thought, yeah, there's a percentage but
 it's five, 10 percentage of the society that is worse off from these. And maybe I'm going to start
 updating that to like the 20th percentile, 20th percentile. But at the end of the day,
 I think that this analysis is both underpowered and poorly designed when it comes to soliciting
 that long tail evaluations. And therefore I remain pretty much convinced that they're getting
 on average and inefficiency from social media usage in this like caldery existence. All right.
