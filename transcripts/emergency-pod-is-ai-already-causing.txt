 (upbeat music)
 - Welcome to the Justified Pasteuriors Podcast,
 the podcast that updates beliefs
 about the economics of AI and technology.
 I'm Seth Benzel, born too late
 to screw over millennials with government deficits,
 but just at the right time to screw over
 Generation Alpha with AI,
 coming to you from Chapman University
 in sunny Southern California.
 - And I'm Andre Kraken, putting on my miners hat
 as I run into the coal mine,
 finding those supposed canneries,
 coming to you from the canaries.
 Oh, I thought you were gonna make like the Minecraft reference
 of the children and your and for the mines.
 - The children have experienced many things.
 - The children love Minecraft.
 If Minecraft was a hobby, would you say?
 - Well, it is, but these days,
 the kids are into Roblox, Seth.
 I don't know if you got the memo.
 They got, why can't Porcano list us?
 The reason I'm asking you, Andre,
 is like, is Minecraft exposed to AI
 and arc the kids these, the kids these days?
 Interested in Minecraft is because
 we're reading something today about
 how does the rollout of AI technologies
 affect employment and occupational outcomes
 for youthful people, which is really exciting
 given that youthful people will be paying
 my social security benefits with any luck.
 (laughing)
 - That's a very selfish way of looking at it, Seth.
 - I'm sure future generations also have intrinsic value.
 I say this as someone who is just reproduced.
 So, you know, step right.
 - Tip of the cap.
 - So this is, we are as a brief personal aside.
 This is the first episode recording post my paternity.
 And I'm as obsessed with intergenerational justice as ever.
 Can't say it's changing.
 And Andre, not only can I not say that,
 what I also cannot say is that there is no emergency
 because there is an emergency.
 This is our first emergency podcast as well.
 What's the emergency, Andre?
 - Well, you know, listeners of the show
 and followers of the AI discourse will know
 that the public demands evidence
 that the AI is taking our jobs.
 But so far, the world has not provided said evidence.
 - Unfortunately, reality has not complied.
 (laughing)
 - Reality has been slow to comply.
 So obviously we've been on the lookout.
 And I think everyone has been on the lookout
 for this first evidence that AI is doing something
 to the labor market.
 And recently, there have been two papers
 that report to show that there are effects of the AI
 on certain aspects of the labor market.
 And one in particular has gotten a lot of media attention
 by our postdoctoral advisor, Eric Brynjoffson,
 Bharat Chandar and Rayu Chen,
 called Canaries, Canaries, in full line,
 six facts about the recent employment effects
 of artificial intelligence.
 A lot of our listeners and a lot of people around the world
 want someone to actually read this paper
 rather than just reading the abstract and publicizing it.
 - Clearly, it's been the paper heard around the world.
 And if you're listening in,
 you're gonna get the inside scoop about,
 what do we actually learn from this emergency dump
 of information?
 - Yeah.
 So, you know, as in our usual format,
 we should state our prior set, isn't that right?
 - Like we said, we're talking today about,
 is the AI taking our jobs?
 But specifically, is the AI taking
 those good gen alpha jobs, right?
 That, you know, people graduate from college,
 they're ready for their new software engineering career,
 they're ready for their new customer service career
 or marketing management career.
 And SNAP, actually that entry level job
 doesn't exist anymore, Andre.
 We're gonna give that to the AI.
 Or at least that's how the,
 it's most pejoratively framed.
 So, the first question that this paper is speaking to
 is this idea that US entry level employment growth
 has been slower for the most AI exposed occupations
 since 2022, right?
 So, is there something about the combination
 of young workers and AI exposed jobs
 that's leading to a depression and hiring?
 So, how do you think about that?
 - Yeah, I mean, just, you know,
 to like think about this from first principles,
 it's not something that I spend my days,
 you know, looking at these numbers, right?
 So, does it plausible to me that this employment,
 you know, could be decreasing?
 - Sure.
 - But also, is it plausible to me that it's not decreasing?
 Also, could be possible, you know,
 we had a pretty good economy,
 at least according to most metrics,
 especially the unemployment rate.
 So, if we think that useful labor gets employed,
 then it seems that it would be hard to find something
 on the employment rate of the youth
 since they have a pretty low unemployment rate.
 So, let's do, you know, obviously we've read the paper
 at the usual conceit of the show, right?
 But we're slicing to a subset of jobs, right?
 - Right.
 - And so, even a big percentage of a subset of jobs
 might be a very tiny percentage
 for the overall employment rate of a particular demographic.
 - So, you know, I think I'd be surprised
 if it's more than an order like 10%.
 - You're comparing, like, the most exposed jobs,
 the least exposed job, you would not be surprised
 if the most exposed jobs grew 10% slower
 for entry-level workers.
 - Yeah, I think plus or minus 10% would be plausible.
 - Oh, even minus 10% would be lovely.
 - Yeah, well, the script is, I mean, look,
 there's industry variation in hiring rates
 and exposure is correlated in the street.
 And so, why not?
 - Why not?
 - I mean, I'm taking the prior seriously.
 - No, no, plus four years, because I did not even try
 to attack this sort of magnitude question
 of how big the effect is, because I agree with you
 that even signing this is a little bit complicated, right?
 We, what was the last month of discourse?
 The last month of discourse was how many hundreds
 of millions of dollars does it take to hire
 a 25-year-old superstar software engineer, right?
 So, like, it's not immediately obvious
 that the AI is reducing demand
 for skilled young people who work with computers, right?
 That being said, it's fair to say
 that those superstars are maybe not representative
 of the median person, or maybe the person
 who's in this data set, something to think about.
 The very top AI superstars are probably not
 in this data set.
 But for thinking more like median people,
 I'm thinking about the story that we heard
 from another friend of the show, Matt Bean,
 whose book "The Skill Code" is a lot about how companies
 are struggling in this AI age to figure out what to do
 with their entry-level workers.
 Because if you can automate the simplest thing,
 and that was the thing that helped you onboard people,
 now you've got, like, a question of, like,
 do I even want to hire entry-level people?
 If I do hire entry-level people,
 is it gonna be even more emphasizing training,
 and it's gonna be an even longer training period
 before they're positively productive?
 And I'd say, on net, that story, I think,
 makes the most sense to me.
 And so I thought maybe 70% chance going in,
 we would find a sign in the direction that the authors claim.
 That America as a whole, there really is some sort
 of difference here that the youth are doing poorly
 in AI-exposed occupations.
 We're not really thinking about software engineering.
 I'm thinking about customer service
 and certain kinds of management bureaucracy jobs.
 - So Seth, are you already mixing in the descriptive
 and the causal?
 - Oh, did I say something causal right there?
 - Well, you gave a story that's a causal story
 for why--
 - Well, a causal story generates the description, right?
 You know, I think reality is caused by things.
 - No, so to be clear, there are many other reasons.
 Like I mentioned, just why things fluctuate, right?
 So industries have ups and downs.
 I mean, we'll talk about some of these in the episode.
 So it's not-- - There's a lot
 of confounders pushing in the--
 - If you looked at, like, employment for the youth
 across sectors over time, you would see a lot of variability.
 And none of that has to do anything with AI.
 We'll see a lot of variability.
 So even though the AI is a story in the mix, right,
 it's a separate question of whether that's a primary.
 If we do find this thing, is that the primary reason
 for it or is something else?
 - Very well put. - So what do you think about that?
 - Very well put.
 I think let's save all the confounders we have in mind
 for a little bit later in the description.
 But yes, absolutely, one of the reasons
 that I'm putting such a high probability
 on finding this descriptive result
 is I also have some non-causal theories
 about why we would say it.
 - I see, yeah, and I guess what I would say is that
 it's a really interesting time
 to be running these sorts of studies
 and thinking about base rates.
 I think this goes really to my point
 about the demand for research.
 This is an obvious research paper
 in the sense that, like, I've had this idea,
 I can give you the document that, right?
 - We've seen people do it.
 - In March.
 - So it's just a question of getting the right data
 and that's one of the tricky things.
 - It's a very special data set.
 - You're looking at a slight, yeah,
 you're looking at slices of subsets of people
 that might be hard to measure in certain data sets.
 And then there's obviously this other thing
 is that there are many ways to skin a cat, you know,
 you can analyze the data set many ways.
 And we've seen headlines that there's been, you know,
 as recently as a few months ago,
 there's no evidence that AI is affecting labor market.
 And I would see a paper as a,
 but AI is affecting the labor market.
 So to me, you know, I actually,
 my base line thing was it can't be that big of an effect
 'cause we would have seen it already,
 like in a more obvious ways.
 And the, like, 100 different research teams
 that are writing the same exact paper,
 one of them would have, like, gone it.
 So the question is how quickly,
 how quickly did you expect this finding to come in
 from research teams?
 - Well, what's the twist?
 Why this result, just mechanically,
 mechanically they're able to find this result
 'cause previous studies had mixed together age groups.
 - Well, let me push back against that.
 The previous studies certainly have looked,
 like once again, this is a very obvious,
 not in a bad way, this is such an obvious idea
 that anyone looking at this set of data
 would have looked at this.
 - This is the first thing you should do.
 - This is the second thing you should do.
 The first thing is not split out by the groups.
 This is the second thing you should do.
 So there was a little bit of an insight there
 to think, look at the age split.
 - It's so obvious-- - I know, you know.
 - It's like read Matt Bean's book.
 - I'm sure other people have looked at the split,
 probably with a data set that was maybe more noisy.
 - I'm not aware of the data.
 So the studies I know about are like industry level,
 firm level, I've never seen occupation times age before
 as a split on one of these.
 - Well, I guess what I tell you is
 they probably looked at it, it was noisy.
 And then they decided not to put in the paper.
 - Just being honest about how research works
 in this field, right?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - So I guess what I'm trying to say is that
 it's actually interesting to think about
 if this was going on, how early would we be able
 to detect it as a society?
 Because maybe that's actually also an interesting policy
 and research question.
 So like, does research come in with a one year lag?
 Does it come in with a three year lag?
 It's kind of an interesting metascience thing.
 - Right.
 So you know, changing at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 these days may be able to take even longer
 to find out what's going on with employment and the economy.
 - But yeah, to me, it seems like
 obvious question, good new data set, I guess.
 - Yeah, so I think we should introduce the paper
 and come what it does, because I do think that
 that's kind of what the authors would say.
 Like, yes, but we have this better way,
 more powerful data set that can study the same.
 - Okay, so what do they do, what's the data?
 I mean, in a sentence, they use this amazing data set
 from ADP, which is one of the world's largest HR companies.
 They say covering firms with 25 million employees
 in the United States.
 And with this really vast data set covering
 from most of their analysis is for since 2020,
 some of the analyses go back to 2018.
 They ask, what are the patterns we see
 for people by employment times occupation,
 and then by the age of the worker.
 So again, there's a little bit of a conflation here.
 They want to talk about entry level jobs,
 but they're actually talking about ages of humans.
 I don't know if that bothers you,
 that little back and forth, but that's what they do.
 Econometrically, it's pretty straightforward.
 There's just some straight up, you know,
 descriptive statistics saying this went up this percent,
 this went down that percent.
 There's some event study stuff trying to argue
 that it's all happens kind of right after the start
 of 2022 with chat GPT.
 And then finally, they do some additional controls
 and additional splits for confounders
 that we can talk about.
 You think that's a fair description?
 - Yeah, I think that's a reasonable description.
 - Okay, so just to talk about the data for a second,
 they have to do some cleaning of it.
 You know, they start throwing out people older than 70,
 younger than 18.
 It's not exactly clear why you would need to do that
 if the data was perfect.
 - Yeah, they have a balanced panel.
 They kind of ensure that they're looking at firms
 that are consistently of a certain size
 throughout the entire time period they're looking at.
 And primarily their results are looking at a time period
 between 2021 and 2025.
 - Exactly.
 - So firms can certainly range over that time period?
 - Definitely.
 One note I would add here, the small nimble startups
 are probably using alternatives to ADP as well,
 or maybe just doing bookkeeping by hand
 if you're a really micro company.
 - The other thing I would say about this data is
 there's a lot of heterogeneity in firm characteristics,
 details on the occupational structure of the exact occupation.
 There's some additional texts you get from ADP
 describing the occupations.
 Lots of stuff on worker characteristics,
 like where these people live.
 It doesn't show up in this paper,
 but I'm aware from this data set,
 there's a lot of different directions you could go
 with this data as they wanted to keep on pushing.
 Okay.
 So how do they use this ADP data?
 They combine it with two other data sources,
 which listeners of this show have already learned a lot about.
 The first is from Friend of the Show at number six,
 I think we're up to now.
 Daniel Rocks, Elian do at all paper that is called GPT
 says for at our GPTs,
 which develops a measure of the exposure
 of different occupations to AI,
 exposure, just meaning it would be really useful
 to have AI systems to speed you up.
 Here we're using their secondary measure,
 their beta measure, which takes into account
 you also have to make complimentary innovations
 in addition to the AI to do the job.
 So that's thing one, they're gonna use
 to in order to split occupations by more or less AI exposed.
 And the second thing they're gonna use is
 what we talked about in our anthropic AI index episode,
 which is this data from anthropic
 that they've released on what share of communications
 with their chatbot seem to relate to different jobs.
 And then they're gonna do one further
 and try to figure out whether those requests
 are more kind of automate-e or augment-e.
 - Yeah, which is something I recall you really disliked.
 - Dude, I don't, man.
 And the worst part is when they say
 automation, automate-e versus augment-e is really important.
 And then they say, the citation for that
 is Eric's Turing Trap paper, book or like essay,
 which also does not engage with this issue.
 Something that we keep on coming back to
 is it really is not useful for talking about
 a technology in isolation as automotive
 versus augmentative, that really you have to understand
 the entire economic system to understand
 whether a technology is going to boost or reduce
 the demand for a certain kind of labor.
 So, I don't know, my eyes roll super hard
 whenever I see something like that.
 - Yeah, but anyway, it's still an empirical question
 whether these things are correlated with-
 - Right, so they're a different cut yet,
 whether or not you wanna connect them to automating.
 They're different uses, and do you wanna talk briefly
 about the econometrics?
 It's pretty straightforward.
 - Yeah, so we can just go figure by figure.
 So, figure one, the headcount over time
 for software developers and customer service
 representatives by age group.
 And they're gonna normalize this in script statistics
 so that everyone is at 100 in the middle of 2020.
 The early career workers, so those between 22 and 25,
 the trend changes at exactly the point that they picked
 to start going down.
 - How convenient.
 - 20/20 is when they invented AI, right?
 - I think so.
 And then the other series, for the most part,
 keep going up, except that 26 to 30-year-olds
 are kind of flat or maybe a little declining.
 Yeah, so before we get into the rest of the evidence,
 I think this is like a tricky thing.
 It's always great to plot the data, of course,
 but we can't learn that much from a simple plot
 because we kind of don't know the kind of actual,
 I mean, we just generally don't know the kind of actual,
 but like--
 - Right, it's a very short series.
 - So they're plotting two occupations, right?
 Lots of things could be going on.
 There could be changes in demographics.
 There could be changes in how long it takes people
 to graduate college because of a particular pandemic.
 There could be changes in demand for labor
 and other occupations that might draw people away
 in front of them, software, customer service.
 - Right, maybe this is demand for money.
 - Yeah, so there really is a lot of stuff
 that could be going on and like thinking really hard
 about how to normalize it.
 It's just important to do.
 So I think it's a good figure one,
 but we need the rest of the evidence.
 And I do want to reiterate that to me, at least 2022
 is definitely not where I expect this to start.
 It seems like the special time,
 especially because there's no like acceleration.
 I'm looking at the trend.
 So if you wanted to tell a story where maybe 22
 is the beginning, but then things start accelerating,
 it doesn't really look like that.
 It looks kind of straight line decline starting in late 2022.
 - Yeah, and for software developers,
 you see it flatten out even before 2022.
 There's no way this is AI, like just time wise,
 like when you think about really capable versions
 of chat GPT, you know, this is not the right time
 like to be thinking about.
 - And I guess what I would say here is,
 it's just such a short time series
 that like, I don't know, if we had 70 years,
 would we see, you know, the different age groups diverge
 and then come back together and then diverge again?
 I don't know, right, it comes back to what your,
 like your prior is.
 If your prior is everything should,
 all the different age groups should follow each other
 perfectly, your prior is,
 I would want to see the historical time series
 for how often that happens,
 then this one event is only one data point.
 So it can't really come into you.
 - I mean, I do, I think I want to bring up something else here,
 which, you know, you think about like something
 like customer service.
 I don't know like how big of a sector unemployment
 that is in the United States.
 But like, if I was a young person,
 be pretty stupid to enter this field.
 Like no offense to people who do it, right?
 Because even if there isn't like a decreased demand
 for customer service,
 it's kind of the first thing we expect to go.
 If we were to like go down the list of things
 that we expect Chad should be to be doing.
 I guess Eric and company and other paper
 has shown that actually customer service
 become more efficient as a result of AI.
 So that's kind of a natural thing to think about.
 So even the question of what is the supplier demand story
 is not answered a graph like this?
 - Well, of course, it's got a quantity, right?
 And you know.
 - But the normative implications
 are quite different, right?
 - Right.
 - If there was a bunch of these people
 who wanted to become customer service agents,
 and then they just couldn't.
 It's very different than people are just looking for
 to make a little money when they're graduating.
 And before they might have joined customer service,
 but now they're like, well, this is a complete dead end.
 And I'm not gonna do this stuff.
 And they have to do.
 - I can't imagine all the people
 who are going into customer service
 saying this is not a dead end.
 - Well, there are a lot of older folks
 that work in customer service as well.
 It's a job that has been open to remote work for a long time.
 - There are lots of properties of the job.
 - You can do it part-time.
 - Yeah, like I'm saying is that lots of things
 could be going on there.
 - I guess just to speak to the,
 could this be supply, side driven results?
 We've talked about how there've been predictions
 for a decade now.
 I remember talking with you in the Sloan building at MIT,
 must have been 2017 about truck drivers
 getting automated.
 And there seems to have been a kind of anticipatory effect
 of people not developing truck driving expertise
 before they actually got automated.
 - Yes, exactly.
 Let's continue the next piece of evidence.
 So then they kind of-
 - Figure two is just more occupations.
 - More occupations.
 - They're just showing that something like home health aids,
 there's actually disproportionate growth
 in young youth employment.
 Whereas for customer service,
 there is this proportionate shrinking
 for youth employment and customer service.
 I guess what I would say here is,
 if it's this draw away story,
 you could see a story where we're getting more polarized
 into physical versus non-physical tasks, right?
 And maybe your some sense in which technology
 is moving young people into being health aids,
 but it's not so much that their current job
 is getting automated.
 It's that the wage for being a young strong person
 is going up.
 - Yeah, they know that healthcare is gonna be an occupation
 for a long time and they're just gonna do that.
 - Yeah, and society is getting older and more infirm.
 So there's a lot of the anticipatory possible effects here
 and pushes and pulls.
 - Yeah.
 - And then one of the other things to note is that
 you might think that of all the time series
 of all the age groups,
 youth are the one that are gonna be the most volatile.
 - Right.
 - Of just how labor markets work, right?
 - And we're coming off of the pandemic,
 which, you know, screwed up in generation of students.
 - Let's talk, we're talking about the confounders.
 - We're getting confounders, here we go.
 - Let's just do it, let's just do it.
 I mean.
 Yeah, so, I mean, there are kind of two things
 that one would like off the bat think about here.
 One is there's a sense that the software industry
 driven by low interest rates completely overhired
 for a long period of time.
 And then a lot of the big tech just started firing people.
 And we know like factually why that happened
 and it wasn't AI, it like-
 - It was interest rates.
 - It was interest rates, it was fiscal discipline, you know,
 there's just a sense that like we gotta cut the fat,
 you know, some people aren't contributing, you know,
 that sort of thing. - And almost by the fat
 is going to be a person who's been there for less time.
 - Yeah, or just hiring less is the easiest way.
 You know, let things churn,
 there were a bunch of hiring freezes.
 - All right, okay, let me get you back on this this way.
 Okay, one theory here is what we're seeing is not
 AI is taking youth jobs.
 What we're seeing is interest rate goes up.
 A youth job in an AI exposed occupation
 is the kind of job where you need to be trained
 for a year, two years, three years.
 And so interest rates go up.
 Hiring someone to train them for three years
 becomes less attractive, right?
 - Yeah. - Okay, so you would say,
 okay, so then that job loss wasn't caused by AI.
 But what if the increase in interest rates
 was caused by AI?
 - Oh my.
 - I know it's too early.
 - It seems too early.
 I mean, yeah, it's just clear, like,
 I think we're just listing other things
 that could contribute to this trend.
 I think I'm with you that certainly,
 the AI story could be there,
 it could be there, especially in the later part of the sample
 where I believe the timing makes more sense.
 But yeah, the other really natural one is,
 man, education, college education,
 high school education during the pandemic was a mess.
 (laughing)
 It was really bad.
 It was very dry. - Yeah, we tried, but I mean,
 it was not a good one.
 And I think this, you know, a lot of things happened,
 but soon you hear stories about people
 aren't like as confident as being social.
 The learning that occurred was much lower,
 you know, that's been shown in a variety of settings, right?
 Just taking a class on Zoom reduces learning.
 You're gonna go into an interview
 for a technical subject like programming.
 You're gonna do worse.
 - Well, Jeff, right, that story,
 it seems like I'd suffer more for the social job
 or the job that isn't gonna get AI exposed.
 - No, I mean, I think to the extent
 that any technical skill, I guess interviewing
 is a combination of social technical.
 And I'll say this is my career as I'm a terrible interviewer
 is that, you know, it's not just about technical,
 but it's both.
 And so if you're both worse socially and worse technically,
 you might be less likely to get that job via interviewing.
 - To explain this story, you have to tell a story
 where that affects you more in the AI exposed jobs.
 - Sure, I understand that.
 I guess I'm just saying that learning rates
 in an interview processes can interact in interesting ways
 and they might interact differently for different types
 of jobs. - Fair enough.
 And it's plausible that it's not like training.
 All right.
 - Look, I think one thing that we need to think,
 like always acknowledge in terms of like a macro clown
 is like humility about jobs.
 Like, I don't know the scope of all the jobs in the world, right?
 I don't know their interview policies.
 All I know is that for like software engineering jobs,
 there are like these very structured knowledge-based
 interview processes that are kind of unusual
 or else I've said other jobs and you know,
 other places which have similar structure might be like,
 a trend interviews, maybe banking into these rates.
 - Those are AI exposed, though.
 - Yeah.
 I mean, so that just goes to show you like,
 it's just hard to like,
 it's hard to, this is a plausible confounder,
 but you know, we need to think harder about it.
 - Yeah, and I mean, I know that home health aides
 certainly don't have long technical interviews, so.
 - Absolutely not.
 It's a very easy interview process relatively, so.
 - I just, I, so I just did it with my,
 we just hired an Andy for my baby.
 And it really was like, I just watched them
 for half an hour to see if they killed it.
 (laughing)
 And they didn't, so they were hired.
 - Okay, so now we go to figure three.
 A nice thing about this paper is it is very clear
 about what's going on and it's just,
 we're looking at figures and interpreting them.
 So figure three uses L&DOW and all,
 so GPT's or GPT's paper as a measure of exposure to AI.
 - By the way, what the authors will say is
 and it's definitely not a measure of automation.
 - It's definitely not, this is going to take your job.
 It just-- - Absolutely not.
 - The episodes on this are free.
 - Well, what we can look at is kind of
 the dispersion in these trends across these categories.
 And we see at the darker lines here, the more exposed lines,
 they flatten out for early career people,
 but then for other folks, they move lockstep
 with most similar jobs, although there are other lines
 that substantially deviate from the trend in this plot.
 For example, for 31 to 34 year olds, less exposed,
 the two less exposed jobs really increase in headcount.
 And so-- - And in suggestions,
 there seem to be a lot of seasonality
 in the least exposed jobs, right?
 In-tip bump. - Yeah.
 - So what's the least exposed job?
 It's like harvesting fruit.
 Yeah, so yeah, there's a tourism,
 I'm sure, is somewhere in there, you know.
 Yeah, and these, you know, even in the pre...
 One of the interesting asymmetries about these plots
 is there's one year of pre-period,
 or a little more than a year of pre-period,
 and a few years of post-period.
 So it just looks that in the before period,
 there's less variation, but actually it's hard
 to make that visual comparison.
 - Do you want to skip four and go right to five,
 or do you want to talk about four for a second?
 - Well, let's talk about five.
 - Five is, in terms of plotting time series,
 they just show that overall change in employment
 by exposure group.
 And here they pool one to three and four to five.
 I would just say that to keep pooling persistent,
 especially since. - It's a garden authority.
 - You're slicing and dicing a little over here.
 I don't think they did anything nefarious, but just, you know.
 - I'm sure it works the same if it's one to two.
 - I'm sure it works the same, but it just,
 you want to keep that similar.
 - Yeah, but standard errors would be much appreciated as well.
 - Yeah, so, but Andre, I'll say I like this figure
 in some ways more than the plots, the event studies,
 because it seems like at the end of the day,
 you just want to look at the end and look at the difference
 between the different groups.
 And this figure is kind of summarizing that.
 - Well, I think one of the reasons I,
 I mean, I'm really glad we saw the previous figures
 because we see that the timing truly does not line up with AI.
 But here you might think, you know,
 you don't know at what time the actual selection point had.
 - So this figure is how I want the results
 reported it numerically, but yeah, of course.
 The event study gives you timing information.
 In terms of magnitudes, I like this figure.
 - Yeah, so y-axis is just the growth in number of jobs
 by age group, and we see kind of everything is up,
 except for the exposed jobs for 22 to 25 year olds.
 - Right, yeah.
 - 'Cause they've got 20 million observations.
 - Yeah, well, they're significantly different from each other.
 I guess what I would have loved to see
 is just some comparison to historical fluctuations
 of other time periods.
 - And it's where I come back to,
 I don't know about a lot of age times occupation
 based research.
 I'm sure you could construct something using the census,
 but I haven't seen, yeah, I haven't seen this.
 - So I think there's a literature
 about how bad it is to graduate in our session.
 - Right.
 - And that is all about the youth,
 and all about how much youth employment fluctuates,
 and how if you're unlucky,
 and you do graduate in our session,
 your career trajectory is worse.
 - And you've seen that like occupations?
 - I haven't seen that time station, which is an occupation.
 But I think like to me, I'm using that as kind of
 some evidence that there's more fluctuation
 than that for graduates, essentially.
 - Well, yeah, I guess the meta point here
 is it's not something special about the skills
 of young people that's important here,
 but rather just whenever there's a reorganization
 in society, the reallocation is gonna happen
 from young people first.
 They are more mobile geographically,
 they're more willing to quit a job and look for a new one,
 than someone who's 50 plus and been in a job forever.
 So for any technological change,
 we would expect there to be more reallocation
 across occupations for young people than old people.
 - Okay, so then, back three is about the--
 - Wait, we should say the magnitude.
 Let's say the magnitude.
 - Yeah, so the magnitude is a decrease in employment
 for quintiles, four and five,
 so for those who are not exposed,
 about a little more than five percent,
 and then there's an increase for one to three.
 - About nine percent.
 - Sorry, for quintiles one to three,
 so the least exposed about nine percent.
 So one way to read this is, well, the causal effect here
 is essentially around nine plus five, but 14, right?
 So 14 percent decrease in employment.
 - So larger, ooh, larger than the effect
 that Andre thought was reasonable.
 - But I said order of magnitude.
 - You were up to 100 percent.
 - But I guess what I'd say here is that the extent
 that people are shifting from four to five to one to three,
 the quintiles that is of exposure, right?
 - It has a very different interpretation
 than if those people, like what really we'd wanna see
 is kind of, if we look at people who ex ante,
 we predict, would end up in occupational categories
 that are most exposed.
 And then what are their unemployment rates?
 And what are their, I think more smoking gun evidence
 would be if they had high unemployment rates
 for CS majors, and we have been seeing some news about this,
 I think would be, in some sense,
 a very complimentary, because if there's substitution
 between one type of job to another type of job,
 that's a, is that a demand or supply set phenomenon?
 Is it very, very large issue?
 - Well, that, there's gonna be substitution.
 That's the thing, it's like,
 nobody's actually think we're gonna like,
 eliminate all youth jobs.
 So it's always going to be a recomposition.
 - Okay, so this is a simple paper,
 so I don't wanna overcomplicate it.
 Maybe we can just briefly say the couple of things
 they try to do to deal with confounders,
 the different robustness checks they do.
 Andre, did you find this robustness check
 where they control for a firm times time
 total employment effect?
 Did that help you at all in terms of thinking
 that this is caused by AI,
 or maybe one of their other controls or splits?
 - I mean, they do also, you know,
 split things out by augmentation versus.
 - Yeah, but we already said that still,
 it's gonna skip that.
 - Well, I mean, it does, you know,
 corroborate their story,
 but I agree that since we think it's silly,
 maybe that's not the right way to,
 and then not the right place to look at.
 So, the specification with the fixed effects, right?
 So the idea here is kind of some firms
 are gonna be hiring a lot,
 some firms are gonna be hiring a little,
 and if we think that hiring is more or less uniform
 across age groups,
 then it'd be surprising kind of,
 like we kind of see deviation from that
 for the use that are in occupations that are like so, right?
 I think it's a reasonable thing to do.
 I think it's a good robustness check.
 - Would you want, I assume they tried,
 because they've got so much data.
 I assume they tried a firm times occupation trend.
 That would, I mean, if they showed me a jump in October 2022
 with a firm times occupation trend, maybe I'd eat.
 - Well, the key thing for me is,
 I absolutely do not want to jump on October 20th.
 - Yeah, well, I just think the timing is wrong.
 The jump of 2022 is what makes me skeptical.
 - It makes it what it has to be interest rates,
 'cause that's the only thing that would be fast.
 - So I guess, yeah, that's--
 - You know, James Carville says about the bottom market.
 - What does he say?
 - He says when I die, I want to be reincarnated
 as either a baseball relief pitcher or as the bottom market.
 It's the bottom market control to everything.
 - That's true.
 All right, so I do think like there is something
 we want to look at in this specification of the fixed effects.
 They plot it in figure nine.
 And if we look at the most exposed group,
 we actually don't see a deviation from trend.
 - Yeah, am I reading that correctly?
 - Or yeah.
 - Yeah, that's much more plausible.
 - That's much more plausible to me.
 But then I think going in with the descriptive stats,
 where the timing isn't, that to me is a little,
 now I'm confused as maybe what I'm trying to say.
 - I think that where we're gonna have to end up is like,
 there's a lot of stuff going on,
 but maybe AI is part of this, right?
 - Yeah, I think that's right.
 - And then the last thing we should talk about
 is the wage change.
 So far we've been talking about employment changes.
 In terms of wage changes, they see really no effect
 by early career times AI exposure on wage growth.
 But I don't know, I'm looking at figure 10
 and looking at early career software developers
 and it kind of seems like it's going up.
 - Good time to be a software developer.
 - Well, it's a polarizing time, right?
 That's what I'm taking away here.
 It seems like the story should be polarization.
 This is the age of giving $100 million
 to the super AI expert, right?
 - Yeah, yeah.
 I think when it's really strange looking at the market
 for software developers, because one of the things
 that I'm thinking about a lot is equity compensation.
 - Equity compensation, there's also title effects,
 or that like when you get paid enough,
 they stop calling you a software developer.
 - Well, I mean, I doubt that 22-year-olds
 are getting such titles, but more like,
 all right, so you got an equity package
 and then the tech industry is booming
 in the stock market over the past few years.
 Is this being captured?
 - And so, maya, are we talking about?
 - I'm gonna use just like knowledge of this data set
 to say that my understanding is that this is taxable income.
 So to the extent that that equity is getting taxed
 in that period, you would see it.
 - Yeah, so essentially we're getting a partial effect.
 So we're getting like the amount that you get invested today,
 but if you're a stock that you're gonna get in a year
 from now, it's gone up a lot.
 - Yeah, might not show up in this year's income.
 - But certainly that might explain part of this
 friend for software developers where
 really the rear ones are getting paid a lot more
 if they have some equity comp and it goes up a lot.
 But then we, well, maybe we'd expect to see that everywhere.
 So then maybe that's, it's unusual that it's
 for early career folks that's going up.
 - I think the story here,
 a story for software is polarization, right?
 That's what it, so we've run through
 all of the main experiments in this.
 They do a couple of other robustness things
 that I'm gonna gloss over.
 Are there any other concerns/confounders
 that you have not already brought of Andre
 that you wanna bring in here?
 - Yeah, so let's talk about one other thing.
 I think it's important to talk about it
 because it does remind me where this is all going
 is kind of a literature that seems very similar
 to the China shock literature.
 - Oh, right, on this one thing,
 the only look at the downsides of this one thing
 and we'll end up with a generation of policymakers
 who are like, did you hear AI took
 that one customer service reps job?
 We gotta shut this down.
 - So just like to recap for those who haven't been following.
 - Autor rule in New America.
 Sorry, that was too strong.
 If you're listening, Autor, I don't only mean that 10%.
 - So pretty much, there are a lot of people
 who are trying to understand what trade with China
 was doing to employment in the U.S.
 And also how it was regionally and occupationally affected.
 And so they came up with exposure measures.
 Is that remind you of something?
 - Yeah.
 And then they kind of found some exposure measure
 that correlated with some employment losses
 in a variety of parts of the country.
 So if you read the papers, they're careful about,
 caveatting that, well, just because there are fewer jobs
 in one type doesn't mean that things are bad
 because of China trade, for example,
 maybe there are other things that are going on
 that might be good.
 And so we have to weigh the pros and the cons,
 but really when that literature was interpreted
 was just how China trade was bad.
 - Right.
 - When it's literally measuring a difference, right?
 - Yeah.
 But to really understand the true effects,
 you need to think about how all this stuff
 is getting reallocated in particular.
 With the China shock, this was kind of like,
 well, U.S firms are getting cheaper inputs,
 customers are getting cheaper goods.
 Maybe employment is substituting.
 I think one of the key things
 with China shock specifically,
 it was like regionally concentrated.
 And so for the people who stayed in certain regions,
 it's certainly, it's hard to argue that it wasn't bad.
 But a lot of people did move
 and maybe people in other regions benefited, right?
 So we kind of have to take that as a whole.
 And I think, it's not crazy to imagine it.
 And once again, not the fault of the authors
 of this paper or any other paper
 is that this type of work, the way that it's framed
 is fun, we're looking for this bad of AI.
 And are we really,
 are we putting in the same effort for the good of AI?
 - Yeah, like if you're thinking of AI to be even snarkier,
 it seems like you could write exactly the same paper,
 exactly the same analyses.
 But the title of the paper is youth employment booming
 in non-AI-exposed industries, right?
 Because it's all just the difference.
 So you could just write a happy story
 about them giving hottest things.
 - I don't think it's all just, I guess, you know,
 I do think, and we talked about all the confounders,
 so I won't go through them again.
 But I do think if you have a theory of AI exposure
 as a substitute for young labor in certain areas,
 and then you see the labor decreasing those exact areas,
 I do think it's more than just,
 oh, we observe a difference, right?
 So, you know, let's be a little more fair.
 If you have the answer--
 - That's in so far equilibrium, right?
 - Yeah.
 - The prices come down of these kinds of goods,
 the prices go bombels up, and the other types are good.
 So yes and no, right?
 The, it's creating destruction.
 Some lose so that we can change.
 - I'd be very worried if overall youth unemployment
 was going up a lot.
 That to me, regardless of why it's a problem.
 And if AI is the problem, then that may call
 for a different type of solution
 than if it's economic uncertainty, right?
 Why do we care about what is the reason for this?
 Why don't we just look at trends as well?
 Different reasons that we address them in different ways.
 There's policy ways to address things.
 There's also kind of just a good advice.
 What advice do we give to young people
 who are entering the labor market?
 You know, and if the story is, well,
 software engineering is dead, don't go into it.
 We should be careful about that story
 versus other stories.
 I remember when I was graduating high school in 2004,
 my high school teachers told me
 that studying programming was a bad idea
 because you know, after the dot-com bust,
 there are too many programmers.
 - I remember in high school them saying,
 oh, you know, computers, they're so good at like adding.
 You shouldn't study math, you should study art
 because computers can't draw.
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's why this matters.
 - Yeah, so do you want to kind of go into posterior mode?
 - I feel the exact thing that you want to talk about.
 - You don't need to go into posterior mode.
 So, Andre, ultimately, is this a canary or a red herring?
 This question was the descriptive question,
 I kind of mixed in some causal statements.
 - Look, I just like that they put the data out there.
 - And you know, getting the agreement
 to get this very rich data is really impressive.
 And, you know, it's a plausible story.
 I guess, yeah, I go back to the plausible story
 that, you know, AI could be involved here,
 but I think that the timing doesn't line up
 with when I'd expect AI to start biting,
 at least in the non-definite results.
 - Right.
 - And it's generally, there's so many other things
 that could be going on
 that I wouldn't view this piece in isolation
 as a canary in the colon.
 - It's not a red herring, so what animal is it?
 - Yeah, yeah, it's neither, I think it's in the middle.
 I think we need to look at this in a variety of ways.
 I think, to me, it's kind of a natural place
 to look at is the employment rates of people
 who expect to be going into these occupations
 based on the majors, also,
 major choice is a very interesting question, right?
 So, you know, if we, this is a supplier demand story,
 always hard to tease out, of course, you know,
 and that wouldn't, but, you know, it's a job posting.
 So there's a recent paper that was released,
 I think like yesterday or the day before
 that was looking at LinkedIn posts
 that kind of seems to suggest corroborating evidence
 on these sorts of occupations.
 - The LinkedIn, yeah.
 We'll do an episode on the LinkedIn data.
 - But I guess what I, you know, yeah,
 that paper uses quite a different, you know,
 strategy to study these questions.
 - It's a little bit more at the firm level.
 - More zoomed in on the AI part of things.
 So, look, I think, you know, it's great
 that people are working on this.
 I expect to have like 100 papers,
 and we'll see if they're kind of helping us
 draw out the shape of the elephant
 that it is AI versus something else.
 - Well, but-- - Yeah, we'll do it.
 - Yeah, so I'll say on the descriptive question,
 this data set's so good.
 I would say I'm at kind of 95%.
 I'm convinced that basically,
 descriptively what they described
 for their 25 million people in their firms
 would well describe the economy as a whole.
 We talked a little bit about some selection in the data set,
 but it doesn't seem devastating.
 In the, in terms of the causal question,
 how does this move me in terms of thinking
 about like, is AI particularly bad for people
 who are just entering the labor force?
 Would you prefer, is this a net negative for you
 in terms of share of income, right?
 'Cause you might imagine that the share of labor income
 going to the youth might go down,
 even if the total labor income of society goes up,
 just 'cause GDP goes up, even if labor share of income goes down.
 Still be a good world, but I am moved in the direction of,
 it's gonna be a good world, but challenging for young people.
 I think I'm now at maybe 75% chance I'm up to,
 that early stage workers are gonna be
 particularly challenged by AI.
 And what's the reason, well, it's kind of the reason
 that technology is often skill biased.
 It's, you know, you automate the simplest thing first
 and you have to put that much effort into it.
 And so young people are either gonna have to be
 in college longer, or they're gonna have to accept
 essentially trainee roles for longer,
 where they get paid like they're true trainees
 and not like they're people who are, you know,
 doing some useful work and getting training on the side.
 So yeah, this does dim my vision for Gen Alpha.
 Of course, they'll make it all up on interest rates
 in the stock market, so I'm not too worried about that.
 - Yeah, it's funny that you bring up the education thing
 'cause I think part of what's going on in this plot
 is that people are taking longer graduate college,
 which would mechanic, you know, in certain majors.
 - But I mean, that's consistent with, I mean, educated.
 - No, but to me, it's consistent with COVID
 really screwing things up for educated people, right?
 Like the kind of the tricky part of all this.
 I think I have a very strong belief
 that it's gonna be a weird time.
 And that makes me worried the most for the youth and the old.
 - Weird's bad for the old.
 - Well, weird in the sense that if you've tried to
 go on your preordained career path
 that we know about and then all of a sudden
 that no longer looks this.
 - Oh, so it's bad for type A trihards?
 - Yeah, it's bad for like those who are just expecting
 a certain career trajectory.
 It might be good for those who are nimble
 because I think every person with AIs
 can have a lot more capability as a result to that.
 - We a lot more last mile problems that show up.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 But if someone being a lawyer, right, you start worrying,
 well, what does an entry level lawyer do?
 Like, hey, I can't do.
 And I know they're thinking about it
 and people are thinking about it before
 they're even going to law school, right?
 So just this inherent uncertainty
 being really amplified right now
 compared to any time that I remember in the past.
 And then I'd be kind of worried about old people,
 you know, to extend that, you know,
 if our society is not providing for them.
 - So security trust fund runs out and lists the.
 - Well, and well.
 - I think that's a good place to have this lovely sunset
 that I'll leave our video users of the podcast with.
 And, you know, we're welcoming Jacob Avram Benzel
 to the world and I, you know, my prediction, Andre,
 is even another 20 years from now,
 they're still going to be jobs.
 - I'm with you.
 I believe in a labor market.
