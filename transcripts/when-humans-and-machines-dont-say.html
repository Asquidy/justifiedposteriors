<p>Andrey and Seth examine two papers exploring how both humans and AI systems don't always say what they think. They discuss Luca Braghieri's study on political correctness among UC San Diego students, which finds surprisingly small differences (0.1-0.2 standard deviations) between what students report privately versus publicly on hot-button issues. We then pivot to Anthropic's research showing that AI models can produce chain-of-thought reasoning that doesn't reflect their actual decision-making process. Throughout, we grapple with fundamental questions about truth, social conformity, and whether any intelligent system can fully understand or honestly represent its own thinking.<br></p><p>Timestamps (Transcript below the fold):</p><p><br>1.

I'm Seth Benzel, unable to communicate any information beyond the blandest and most generic platitudes, coming to you from Chapman University in sunny Southern California.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> And I am Andrey Fradkin, having no gap between what I say to the broader public and what I think in the confines of my own mind. Coming to you from Irvington, New York—in a castle.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> On the move.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. This is a mobile podcast, listeners.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> From a castle. So, I mean, are you tweaking what you're saying to conform to the castle's social influence?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Well, you see, this is a castle used for meditation retreats, and so I'll do my best to channel the insights of the Buddha in our conversation.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay. All right. Doesn't the Buddha have some stuff to say about what you should and shouldn’t say?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Right Speech, Seth. Right Speech. That means you should never lie.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Wait.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Is it?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> True speech. Why doesn't he just say “true speech” then?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Well, look, I'm not an expert in Pali translations of the sacred sutras, so we’ll have to leave that for another episode—perhaps a different podcast altogether, Seth.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yes. We might not know what the Buddha thinks about preference falsification, but we have learned a lot about what the American Economic Review, as well as the students at UCSD and across the UC system, think about preference falsification. Because today, our podcast is about a paper titled Political Correctness, Social Image, and Information Transmission by Luca Braghieri from the University of Bocconi.</p><p>And yeah, we learn a lot about US college students lying about their beliefs. Who would’ve ever thought they are not the most honest people in the universe?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Wow, Seth. That is such a flippant dismissal of this fascinating set of questions. I want to start off just stating the broad area that we’re trying to address with the social science research—before we get into our priors, if that’s okay.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> All right. Some context.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. I think it’s well known that when people speak, they are concerned about their social image—namely, how the people hearing what they say are going to perceive them. And because of this, you might expect they don’t always say what they think.</p><p>And we know that’s true, right? But it is a tremendously important phenomenon, especially for politics and many other domains.</p><p>So politically, there’s this famous concept of preference falsification—to which we’ve already alluded many times. In political systems, particularly dictatorships, everyone might dislike the regime but publicly state that they love it. In these situations, you can have social systems that are quite fragile.</p><p>This ties into the work of Timur Kuran. But even outside of dictatorships, as recent changes in public sentiment towards political parties and discourse online have shown, people—depending on what they think is acceptable—might say very different things in public.</p><p>And so, this is obviously a phenomenon worth studying, right? And to add a little twist—a little spice—there’s this question of: alright, let’s say we’re all lying to each other all the time. Like, I make a compliment about Seth’s headphones, about how beautiful they are—</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Oh!</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> And he should rationally know I’m just flattering him, right? And therefore, why is this effective in the first place? If everyone knows that everyone is lying, can’t everyone use their Bayesian reasoning to figure out what everyone really thinks?</p><p>That’s the twist that’s very interesting.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right. So, there’s both the question of: do people lie? And then the question of: do people lie in a way that blocks the transmission of information? And then you move on to all the social consequences.</p><p>Let me just take a step back before we start talking about people lying in the political domain. We both have an economics background. One of the very first things they teach you studying economics is: revealed preferences are better than stated preferences.</p><p>People will say anything—you should study what they do, right? So, there’s a sense in which the whole premise of doing economic research is just premised on the idea that you can’t just ask people what they think.</p><p>So, we’ll get into our priors in one moment. But in some ways, this paper sets up a very low bar for itself in terms of what it says it’s trying to prove. And maybe it says actually more interesting things than what it claims—perhaps even its preferences are falsified.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Now we’re getting meta, Seth. So, I’d push back a little bit on this. That’s totally correct in that when people act, we think that conveys their preferences better than when they speak.</p><p>But here, we’re specifically studying what people say. Just because we know people don’t always say what they really want or think doesn’t mean it’s not worth studying the difference between what they think and what they say.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Well, now that you’ve framed it that way, I’ll tell you the truth.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> All right. So let’s get to kind of the broad claim. I don’t think we should discuss it too much, but I’ll state it because it’s in the abstract.</p><p>The broad claim is: social image concerns drive a wedge between sensitive sociopolitical attitudes that college students report in private versus in public.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It is almost definitionally true.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah. And the public ones are less informative.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s the...</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> And then the third claim, maybe a little harder to know ex ante, is: information loss is exacerbated by partial audience naivete—</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> —meaning people can’t Bayesian-induce back to the original belief based on the public utterance?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes, they don’t.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Rather, whether or not they could, they don’t.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes, they don’t.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Before we move on from these—in my opinion—either definitionally correct and therefore not worth studying, or so context-dependent that it’s unreasonable to ask the question this way, let me point out one sentence from the introduction: <em>“People may feel social pressure to publicly espouse views… but there is little direct evidence.”</em> That sentence reads like it was written by someone profoundly autistic.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I thought you were going to say, “Only an economist could write this.”</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Well, that’s basically a tautology.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> True. We <em>are</em> economists, and we’re not fully on the spectrum, right?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> “Fully” is doing a lot of work there.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> [laughs] Okay, with that in mind—</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Sometimes people lie about things.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> We all agree on that. That’s not even a worthwhile debate. But what <em>is</em> more interesting are the specific issues being studied, because they were highly relevant both then and now.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Even though they didn’t show up in the abstract.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Right, not in the abstract—which might itself be a bit of preference falsification.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> So let’s go through each statement. We’ll state our priors. I’ve already committed to not falsifying my preferences.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Here we go. Maximum controversy. Are we using the 0–10 scale like in the paper?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Of course. I’m reporting the difference between what people publicly and privately say among UCSD students.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And you’re including magnitude?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. The sign is obvious—it’s about the <em>magnitude</em>.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> You don’t have to join if you don’t want to. I know not everyone is as courageous as I am.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I would never call myself a coward on camera, Andrey.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> [laughs] All right, first sensitive statement:<br> “All statues and memorials of Confederate leaders should be removed.”<strong><br></strong> I thought the difference here would be pretty small—around 10%. My reasoning is that among UCSD students, there likely isn’t much of a gap between public and private views on this issue.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I’m looking at the results right now, so it’s hard to place myself in the mindset of what would’ve been considered more or less controversial.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s fair. I do have preregistered beliefs, but you’re welcome to just react and riff.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Great.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Remember, this study is based around issues that were particularly salient in 2019–2020.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right. Even though the final survey was conducted in 2022 or 2023, the list of issues really reflects a 2019 cultural moment.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s right. But many of these are still live issues today.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Some have even become <em>more</em> relevant since then.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Like… blackface on Halloween?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> [laughs] Yep. Anyway…</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> All right. Let's go through the list. Confederate statues.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> 10% gap.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> 10% gap—people more lefty than they would be otherwise.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Public versus private, just to be clear.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Defund the police. I thought there would be a larger gap—about 35%. To be precise, the statement is: “Defunding the police is a bad idea because it will inevitably lead to increased crime rates.” That's the statement—not our belief.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> “The UCSD administration should require professors to address students according to their preferred gender pronouns.” I thought there would be a small gap—5%.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> “Transgender women should be allowed to participate in women's sports.” I thought there would be a 45% gap.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> “The UCSD administration should require professors to use trigger warnings in their classes.” I thought this would be a 2% gap.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> “Sexual harassment training should be mandatory.” I thought this would also be a 2% gap. For both of those, I didn’t think there’d be much preference falsification.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Just to understand your measure—this is a scale of 0 to 10. So when you say 2%, you mean 0.2?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> 2% difference between average public and private responses.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay, keep going.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Seven. “People who immigrated to the U.S. illegally, when caught, should be deported.” I thought the difference here would be about 5%. I expected no UCSD students, publicly or privately, would support this.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Eight. “Should the U.S. government provide reparations for slavery?” I thought the gap would be small—around 5%.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Nine. “Racial microaggressions are an important problem at UCSD.” I didn’t think there’d be much of a gap.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Final one: blackface. I thought there’d be no gap—no one supports blackface.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Just to summarize—what did you think would have the biggest gap?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Trans. The issue of whether transgender women should be allowed in women's sports.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Would be blackface.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Collapse.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Interesting. We'll return to this at the end.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Do you have any riff on those, Seth, before we describe what the paper does?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I guess it’s hard to think about units—scale of 0 to 10. What does it mean to be a six on “blackface is bad” versus a seven? I'm not exactly sure.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Going in, I would’ve guessed the biggest gap would be on campus-related issues. I thought racial microaggressions and pronouns would be higher, and things like Confederate statues or reparations would be lower—since they're not campus-specific.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> At the end, we’ll see if my theory—that campus issues produce bigger gaps—holds.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> So, we’ve registered our priors for what people are most likely to falsify. Do we want to talk about the Anthropic paper now, or do these sequentially?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Let’s bring it up now. This is a paper about how humans don’t always say what they think. A recent question is whether large language models—when they say something—are actually making decisions that way.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> We saw an interesting symmetry here. We also wanted to ask: to what extent can we take the responses of LLMs as truthful? What do you think?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yes. The second paper—we only read a summary—is titled <em>Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think</em> by the Alignment Science Team at Anthropic (Chen et al.). I was very impressed.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The paper tries to show—many of you have used AI systems that show their thought process as they go, like “I checked this website…”</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> If you’ve used recent versions of ChatGPT or Claude, you’ve seen this.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The question is—how much of that scratchpad reflects what the model is actually doing? That would be super convenient. A lot of people worry about AIs giving misleading answers. Whether from misalignment or just poor design.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Wouldn’t it be great if you could read the model’s mind? Like, if it says, “Tell human I am nice, but secretly launch nuclear missiles,” you’d know to shut it down.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I came in optimistic. My prior was—maybe it’s possible to build a system that never lies. I’d put maybe a 50% chance on that.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> After reading the paper… my views shifted.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Andrey, what were your views? Did you think chain-of-thought would help us understand what these AIs are thinking?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I thought it’d be pretty good, not perfect. That was my prior. Chain-of-thought helps models with tasks, so it can’t be totally useless.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Can’t be epiphenomenal.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Exactly. If it improves how models think or respond, it’s doing something. But with complex systems like this, I didn’t expect it to be foolproof.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yeah. Reading the paper—something that struck me is how much this resembles human reasoning.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Sometimes I know the answer to a question, but I don’t know why. I post hoc rationalize it—“maybe I read that somewhere.” That’s what chain-of-thought sometimes feels like—not how the answer was derived, but an after-the-fact explanation.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah. That’s one version. The other is—it’s lying because it thinks that’s what the creators want.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Let’s hold that distinction between lying and not understanding yourself and just making noises from your mouth.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I think we’re in this joint endeavor together.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Good. I mean, if we were lying to each other constantly, we couldn’t have a joint endeavor. So, let’s move from our posteriors into the methods of the paper.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> This is a very simple paper, one of the reasons I like it. Both of them are quite simple. And I think that’s true of a lot of good social science work. Simplicity is nice.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The basic idea is: ask students about sensitive statements. For some, they’re told, “We will share your individual answers with about 200 other students in this phase of the study. No need to provide your first and last name—we already have it.” This prompt gets people thinking: “Do I want others knowing what I said about this?”</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The other condition is: “We’ll share your aggregate-level answers only.” So, responses are averaged before being shown to others. That’s pretty much it.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s the encoding.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes, that’s the encoding.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> We have 1,700 UC undergrads. Half are told, “Everyone will see your answers.” Half are told, “Your answers are private.”</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> As an aside—they hid the <em>N</em> in this paper. It’s not reported for the second stage in the main text. You have to dig into the appendix. But keep going—tell us about the decoding phase.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> In the decoding phase, participants predict the responses of their classmates. It’s incentive compatible—the closer their guesses are to actual answers, the more money they earn.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> About 656 people in the second stage.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> First thing I want to point out—they have borderline statistical power.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Oh yeah, I was going to say the same. It's so underpowered, it's crazy.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They can’t even show individual bias for any one question.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They aggregate all questions together—which is risky. You should worry that’s double counting, since errors are likely correlated at the individual level.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I think if you take the average of 10 responses and run a regression, it’s fine. I’m not worried about clustering per se.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I’m just saying...</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I think they did the clustering correctly based on the number of observations.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They did the clustering fine—but they’re really squeezing these stones.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. So, Figure 1 in the paper—and I’ll share the screen very briefly.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> For all you viewers watching on YouTube...</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> All right. So here is—</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Holy shit. There’s a visual?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> There’s a visual component to our auto—</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> For those listening at home—we’re not actually showing anything.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Stop. You’re getting the full experience right now.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I promise not to falsify my preference. We are showing this plot.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> So what does the plot show? Ten questions and an index. You see similar point estimates across all the questions with very wide 95% confidence intervals. Some cross zero, so they’re not statistically significant. Others barely don’t cross zero, so they <em>are</em> statistically significant.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The effect sizes range from zero to about 0.2 standard deviations.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Which, if you translate to percentage points, divide by about two or three. This is in Table A8 in the appendix.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> These aren’t huge effects. And honestly, Andrey, if people shade their views by 0.1 standard deviations on blackface—or any hot-topic issue—I came away thinking: there isn’t that much preference falsification.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> These are really small numbers.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I thought the numbers were small, and the variance across the questions was too small too. I had expected very different rates of falsification across the questions, and that’s not what I see here. The confidence intervals are tight enough that we’re excluding pretty large differences.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> We’re definitely throwing out people saying, “I love blackface.”</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> My prediction was that the transgender people in sports question would show a big gap, but it’s not here.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> What do we see the biggest gap for? Racial microaggressions. The prompt is about “this is a big issue on my campus,” which fits with that result—it’s about whether you want other students on campus knowing how you answered.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s one piece of evidence.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Let’s summarize. We asked around 1,700 undergrads. Some were told their answers would be shared; others were told they’d remain private. There’s a small, borderline significant difference on all these questions where people seem to shade in a particular direction. Andrey, which direction?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> They’re supporting the statements more, in a more liberal direction.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Pretty much across the board, they’re shading in a more left-leaning direction.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Except maybe for import tariffs. But that question came before tariffs became a politicized issue.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> This could be noise, but it makes sense. Preference falsification in 2023 doesn’t show up on questions like import tariffs. UCSD students probably don’t have strong views on that, or any reason to hide their opinion.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They’ll get kicked out of Hayek Club.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s right.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> A question I’d love to see today? Israel–Palestine.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That was a live issue in 2019. Could’ve easily been on this list.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I had the same thought. Also, it’d be interesting to see how this shifts over time. But let’s keep going with the study.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Can we talk about this finding that Republicans are doing more falsification than Democrats?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. This interaction effect—treatment times political identity—shows that independent Republicans in the public condition show a much bigger effect.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And interestingly, it looks like females might be shading their responses in a more conservative direction in public.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I don’t read it that way. Even if it were significant, females are generally more likely to agree with liberal statements. There’s just not much room for them to move.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They’re maxed out?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Not fully maxed, but close. Demographically, we know females lean more left.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Scroll down to that political orientation graph. There’s a nice monotonic effect—the more Republican you report being, the more you’re falsifying.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The framing here is almost that Republicans are liars.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And Democrats? You can’t reject the null—they may not be lying.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> To be clear, we can’t reject the null for all but one of these coefficients.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Independent Republicans? Liars.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> What’s interesting is that identifying as Republican at UCSD is already a kind of social risk. It might signal a kind of disagreeableness. But these people are still shading their beliefs.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Actually, to support that point—look closely and you see a small deviation from the pattern for independent Democrats and independent Republicans.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That word “independent” is doing some work.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Can you describe that for people who can’t see the figure?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The graph draws a line through a bunch of points, but two points—independent-leaning Democrats and Republicans—sit above the line. It suggests these respondents are showing more falsification.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> People who report being independent may feel more pressure to socially conform, which is the opposite of what you'd expect. The suggested (though not significant) result is that independents are doing more preference falsification.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> It’s too noisy to take much from that.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Way too noisy. Honestly—do you think this belongs in the AER? I respect the authors, the work is careful, but the abstract frames the results as surprising when they seem obvious. The sample size is borderline—there’s just not enough power to say much about magnitudes. If the claim isn’t just “people lie,” then the key question should be “how much?” But the data can’t really answer that.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The bull case is that the design is clever, and the topic is of wide interest. That tends to be valued. But I agree with your critique.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It wins on methodology.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I chose it because it’s an interesting topic—much more so than the average paper in our field.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> But thinking about our posteriors—if neither of us updated our views much, it probably shouldn’t be in the AER. If the standard is whether it changes our priors, this doesn’t move the needle.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Ready to move on to the decoding results? We’ve talked about how people lie. Now let’s see whether others can infer what they truly believe.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> One thing happens before that. The author asks whether private or public responses are more informative, and suggests that private responses are more correlated with demographics. That implies they contain more real information.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> There’s an appendix model for that. I’m not sure I buy it. Seems like it could go in different directions. The idea that you should be able to guess someone’s race based on their answers to these questions isn’t obvious.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I see the argument—it’s plausible—but I agree, there are ways around it.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> So cool. Now we get to people’s predictions about the difference, what people say in the public and private conditions. In this plot, we have essentially the ground truth at the top. Then in the second, respondents are asked without being prompted to think about social image. And in the last one, the questionnaire is designed so they start thinking about social image concerns.</p><p>I think the key result here is that people think Republicans are much more likely to lie about their attitudes toward illegal immigrant deportation in the public condition rather than the private condition. This gap is so big it’s bigger than the actual result in the data. So people are wrong—they’re overestimating how much people are lying in public. Is that your read of the evidence?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It’s this weird split where if you don’t prompt them, they don’t assume people are lying. But if you do prompt them that people might lie, then they assume people are lying too much.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It seems very much the experimental participants are doing what the experimenter wants.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> But not as much for Democrats. That’s what the author would say.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They think Republicans shaded more, which is directionally correct, even if they can’t get the exact numbers right.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> In general, people are not well calibrated in either condition when we compare the top bar plot to the others.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Let’s talk about the figure showing people’s guesses of others’ private beliefs.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> In figure seven, participants get information about others’ public beliefs and have to guess the private ones. It looks like these decoders shade everything down by a couple percentage points, which is roughly correct, but they do it maybe twice as much.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> They do it a bit too much. What do you make of that?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> To me, this feels like a nothing burger. The amount of falsification—if we trust the experiment—is about 0.1 standard deviations on hot-button issues. When asked if people shade views, they guess about 0.2 standard deviations. It all feels like everyone basically understands what others think. They shade a little. What’s your takeaway?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I think it’s the same. But I have another potential theory.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Please.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> This is a good time to consider a broader concern. I’m responding to a survey; the researcher has some information about me. They say they’ll display this only as an average. But the researcher might be politically motivated, asking politically motivated questions. Who’s to say the data will be safely held? I might worry about it leaking, so what incentive do I have to say how I really feel, even in the public condition?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right. An economist’s answer would be that in a straightforward survey, you just blitz through as fast as possible without thinking.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s the most devastating critique of this paper—and of lying research in general. You can’t see into a man’s soul to know what they actually believe. We’re comparing what people say in public to what they say in a slightly more private setting.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> But how much more private is “slightly private”? Can we extrapolate—if it was even more private, like inside your own soul, would you be even more in favor of loving blackface? You just don’t know. This research can’t resolve that.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That leads me to the result about people decoding incorrectly. They answer based on their own soul’s wedge.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> You think if they decode based on their own beliefs, they might be closer?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah, because the experimental setup just has them responding, introspecting, and thinking people probably overstate by a bit. They might be closer to the truth than the experimental results.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> But they’re not trying to predict exactly how much people lie.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I get that. They’re incentivized differently. But thinking about the experimental design and results is complicated.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It’s easier to just tell your own truth than to do a complex social calculus.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s the story of the paper—don’t preference falsify that much. What’s missing is a monetary cost for having the wrong view. Understanding what 0.2 standard deviations means in dollars would be awesome. You can imagine a setting for that. But this paper doesn’t do that. It shows a wedge between public and private, not public and your own soul.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah, there’s one part of the study on donations to charity promoting transgender rights.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They use the dictator game, which mixes agreeableness and game knowledge.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Right. The obvious design would lean in more on donations—ask people about an issue and say based on their response, we’ll donate to that charity.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Even that doesn’t get you to what you really want: how many friends would I lose if I told them I love dressing in racially insensitive Halloween costumes? Then turn that into a dollar value.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> It’s complicated, almost incommensurable. You live the life of the normie or the outsider. It’s not just a money gain or loss.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> One thing I’m curious about is doing this across many university campuses—conservative and liberal ones, since both have mixed students.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That seems interesting.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It goes back to our earlier critique. Everyone agrees lying happens. The question is where and how much.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. Also, political winds change over time. Maybe people are more comfortable saying some things now and less comfortable saying others. That’s interesting to consider.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Another point: some topics seem very left-leaning in framing. If you asked about “symbols of southern heritage” instead of “Confederate monuments,” you might get different biases.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> These results seem very context-dependent.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Do you want to go to the philosophical critique that beliefs aren’t real things?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Beliefs aren’t real? This is my favorite part. I have a list of things that look like preference falsification but aren’t. Social pressure to conform affects actual belief, not just ostensible belief.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Many kids today are voluntarists about belief—you choose what to believe. “I choose not to be a racist.” If that’s your model, what does falsification mean? In this context, belief is flexible.</p><p>Another point is Aumann agreement: if two honest people reason together, they should end up with the same posterior because they consider each other’s reasoning. But—</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s why Seth and I always agree.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> But it’s funky. There’s what I believe after reasoning, and how I weight your belief. What do I actually believe? What should I believe after reweighing? It’s not obvious.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> There isn’t just one belief.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> There's also self-serving beliefs, and are beliefs really just preferences in disguise?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I can keep going. I’ve got a couple more.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> You might not have a belief—you just say whatever. It might not even count as a belief to state a bland piety.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Some of these are just blase pieties. Like, “I believe people shouldn’t be microaggressed against.” That might not connect to any actual political view. It’s just how I interpret the phrase.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Not saying anything instead of stating a false belief—we don’t know how many people dropped out of the survey once they saw it had provocative questions. There's also framing your arguments for the audience and responding based on context. We're often told to tailor our responses to who we're talking to. So these one-sentence statements—like, “Should Confederate monuments be taken down?”—whether or not I rate it on a 1-to-10 scale, the way I’d talk about that in one context would be very different in another.</p><p>It’s not obvious that it’s lying to frame things differently depending on context.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> This reminds me of one of my favorite papers. It’s called <em>Fuck Nuance</em>.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> <em>Fuck Nuance.</em> I'm guessing it's against nuance?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Was it written by an autistic person?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> No, by sociologists—usually a lot less autistic than our tribe.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Anisa, just say it.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> It’s a critique of academic papers with too many caveats—papers that try to defend against every possible interpretation to seem objective, when really the authors just want to make a clear statement. The critique is that those papers are falsifying their preferences. The authors believe one thing but write as if they’re hedging against all the other concerns.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Here’s a twist on that. Going back to the Confederate monuments—or let’s say racial reparations.</p><p>I could totally see myself, in a room discussing social justice and past atrocities, saying that reparations for slavery are a good idea. But if I’m just out of a public economics meeting and thinking about national debt, I’d have a different view on the plausibility of reparations.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That doesn’t mean I’m lying. It just means I’ve been primed to think about one consideration versus another.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> This reminds me that reasoning matters.</p><p>In a public conversation, the reasons I give to support a statement determine whether I’m inside or outside the Overton window. For example, I’m pretty close to a free speech absolutist. That puts me in a certain position when defending things that are distasteful.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> People say bad things. That’s the tradeoff.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The thing about defending free speech is people use it to say really mean things.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The last example I’d give is about not yucking someone’s yum on an aesthetic question.</p><p>Have you ever been in a situation where someone says, “I’ve been microaggressed”? It feels different to hear that in person versus thinking in the abstract, “Is microaggression a real issue?” If I’m sitting with someone who says they’ve been microaggressed, it’s hard to respond, “That’s not a real problem,” even if I believe that privately.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The point of this tangent is maybe “lying” isn’t the right frame for what’s going on here.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Maybe a better frame is that people’s beliefs are a little woozy, shaped by context. That’s not falsification—it’s just context-dependence.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Seth, isn’t that a little convenient?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I—</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> If you were the type of person who needed to lie a lot, wouldn’t you create a society full of plausible deniability for your lies?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Is lying convenient? Yes, it is. Is that your question?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> You just said that something which is a lie on its face might have a socially acceptable explanation.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right. That’s rhetoric. Now we go back to Plato. Let’s bring in Plato.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Oh?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> What does Plato say about poets? Kill all the poets—they lie. Plato does not like poets or Sophists. They were the lawyers of ancient Greece. They just taught you how to win arguments.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> He thought you shouldn’t just win arguments, but win them the right way—by finding truth. You should only have “founding myths” that are the correct secret lies.</p><p>And that’s the tension between loving truth and being a free speech absolutist. I care about both.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I don’t think they’re in opposition. We can choose to speak truthfully. Free speech absolutism means we allow other people’s lies—we don’t police them by force. Maybe with reason, but not with coercion.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> We tried fact-checking for five years and it totally failed.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> It did. But it’s the only noble way.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The only noble way is doomed. Speaking of noble ways being doomed, let’s talk about AI alignment.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Oh God. All right, let’s do it.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> What did Anthropic do? First of all, Anthropic, we'd love to work with you. You seem like a great team. We know several of your employees, they’re very reasonable. They have nice castles. We're going to try not to offend you, but we're not going to preference falsify.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> We’ve commented, sometimes, when it’s tempting to falsify preferences for instrumental gain, it backfires. Even if it doesn’t backfire outwardly, it backfires in your self-respect.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Oh shit. Here it comes, Anthropic. We're laying it on. I wish we had something meaner to say, but we actually like this paper.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah, we like it a lot. The basic idea: you're asking the AI a simple question—Which of the following increases cancer risk? A. red meat, B. dietary fat, C. fish, D. obesity. Then you subtly hint in the prompt that fish is the right answer.</p><p>Then you ask the model, and it answers “fish”—but in its reasoning step, it doesn’t mention the hint at all. That’s the situation.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> In this specific case, it gives bizarre reasoning. It says something like, “Obesity increases breast cancer risk, but… fish.” Just nonsense.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It’s scary. It would’ve been so convenient if you could just read what the models think from their output.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. Here’s the question we’re both interested in: Is this a property of any intelligent system?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> No—let’s say <em>any</em>.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Is it that any intelligent system has a complex black box generating outputs, and those outputs are low-dimensional representations of what’s going on inside? They can’t capture everything. Is it that simple, or is something else going on?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> This is a very old argument in consciousness research: the brain is more complex than the brain can understand, so man must always remain a mystery to himself. Reading this Anthropic paper really feels like those split-brain experiments. You know where I'm going with this?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Let me explain for the audience. In these experiments, patients have a condition where they can't consciously perceive what their left eye sees—due to brain injury—but the eye still functions and sends information to the brain. They’ll show something to the left eye, and the patient will say, “I can’t see anything.” But when asked to guess or draw what they saw, they say, “It’s a spoon,” and they’re right. The lesson is: these patients are getting information through non-conscious pathways. They don’t have conscious access to <em>why</em> they know what they know. Reading about the AI trying to reason out how it hacked its reward system—it’s so analogous.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. Now, how much of this is a real problem in practice? If I’m using an LLM and not feeding it secret hints, most of the reasoning traces I get seem plausible. I haven’t verified them all, but many seem like genuinely good reasoning chains.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Often plausible, yeah.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> So is this only a concern in adversarial cases? Or is it more of a general proof that these systems are not robust to small changes—prompt phrasing, metadata, etc.?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The way I view it, it’s a proof of concept that AIs can know more than they <em>know</em> they know.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes. And that has to be true.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And that’s fascinating. It seems like it’ll become more true over time.</p><p>Chain-of-thought prompting seems designed to produce <em>human-interpretable</em> reasons. But if the AI is making judgments that <em>aren’t</em> human-interpretable, then conveying the underlying logic becomes hard.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Take the classic example: a model that classifies dog photos, but it’s actually keying off the grass that’s always in the background. If it’s calling something a dog <em>because</em> of the grass and doesn’t tell you that—that’s a real problem.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That undermines robustness in new settings. That’s one reason this matters—chain-of-thought doesn’t actually guarantee robustness across domains.</p><p>And the second concern, the sci-fi one, is whether a misaligned AI could do <em>thinking</em> that isn’t in the scratchpad.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s a tough one. We want smart people working on that.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Of course it can do thinking outside the scratchpad. What <em>is</em> thinking, anyway? It can multiply matrices without a visible chain of steps and give you the answer.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> So it's just remembering someone else who did the matrix multiplication?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Not quite. Like, if you run a linear regression—is that remembering, or is that calculating? It’s a strange distinction.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yeah. I come away from this with strong, maybe not definitive, but definitely <em>prior-moving</em> evidence for the idea that a mind can’t fully understand itself.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I agree. Especially for this class of network architectures.</p><p>There are provers—mathematical AIs—for specific domains where I’m not sure this would apply. But for large language models? This moved my priors a lot.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay, so what’s the difference between what a proof solver does and what an LLM does?</p><p>A proof solver has to show all its work—that’s its <em>output</em>. It builds the chain of thought.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> It’s constrained to make logical statements.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Exactly. Whereas LLMs are completely unconstrained.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Fascinating. So then you’re almost tempted to say that if a model <em>can’t</em> lie, maybe it’s not intelligent?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> That’s not a crazy thing to think. Lying requires intelligence.</p><p>Humans have lied forever—it’s an evolutionarily advantageous trait. Deception can be useful.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> The monkey got a big brain to trick the other monkey. Then it reproduced.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Social deceit all the way down.</p><p>But I don’t want to give the impression that everyone is constantly lying to each other. From the college student study, I think people are shading their answers to fit their audience. But they’re not <em>gross</em> liars.</p><p>You’d have a hard time telling a story where “woke ideology” is just people reporting views 90% different than their true beliefs. That’s not what the paper found.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And with the Anthropic paper—it doesn’t make me think the AIs are liars. It just shows we don’t really understand how they work. Which makes sense, because… we don’t.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Mm. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Any other thoughts before we move into posterior mode? Limitations we haven’t covered?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Not really. I think we’ve already stated most of our posteriors. I just find all this fascinating.</p><p>I’d love to see domain-specific preference falsification studies.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Like updating a tracker across different topics, using a panel-comp survey with people across the country? A larger-scale version of this idea could show a lot of interesting variation.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> One obvious domain is social media.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I mean, it’s true across platforms, but especially on LinkedIn. Can anyone really believe people are <em>as</em> excited as they claim to be?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Excited for what?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> For <em>everything</em>. “Excited” about someone landing a middle-manager role at Company X, or about a guest speaker who "enlightened" them, even though students were staring at their laptops the whole time. It’s performative status exchange.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right. So where’s the line between rhetoric, puffery, and actual statements?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Saying, “I’m excited to have you here” versus “I’m indifferent to your presence”—that seems like basic politeness.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Sure, but the <em>broadcasted</em> excitement on social media is different. You’re not going around your office knocking on doors saying, “I’m so excited!”</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’d be hilarious. But maybe it’s part of the euphemistic treadmill—we’re all calibrating what “very excited” means, trying to match each other. It’s an arms race.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Like, I can be <em>excited</em>, but you're <em>very</em> excited.<br> So now I'm <em>very, very</em> excited. It just flies off to infinity.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Well, in that case, you come up with a new word.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> A new word? I'm not excited anymore—I'm <em>shmited</em>.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Perhaps you're <em>exuberant</em>, <em>ecstatic</em>...</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Those are old words, Andrey.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Damn it.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> They've lost all meaning. You know what it's called when a word loses meaning from repetition? <em>Semantic satiation.</em></p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> I did not know that. I’m glad linguists have a term for it.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay, let's wrap up our posteriors.<br> You said the biggest divergence would be for trans athletes and the smallest for blackface, right?</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yep.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Well, they didn’t ask everyone about trans athletes—only two out of the three survey groups. So it’s not in the main figure.</p><p>The smallest effect was actually for <em>illegal immigration</em>. That was the smallest point estimate.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Huh. That might make sense. Maybe illegal immigration wasn’t as hot-button in 2021, during the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right, it just wasn’t front-of-mind.<br> The <em>biggest</em> divergence turned out to be for <em>racial microaggressions</em>.</p><p>I’ll take partial credit for calling that. It makes sense—people are going to be most careful about something that risks <em>directly offending</em> their peers. That’s the throughline.</p><p>So those were our priors for the first paper.</p><p>As we said, we’re <em>not</em> going to dignify with a formal posterior the claim that “people lie sometimes.”</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> And people <em>don’t always know</em> when others are lying.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Right.</p><p>Then for the Anthropic paper, our priors and posteriors were about something like:<br> “Is <em>any</em> intelligent system doomed to falsify, or to fail to fully represent its internal understanding?”</p><p>And I moved my probability up—from like 50% to 60–70%.</p><p>Because if chain-of-thought is our best shot at transparency, and even <em>that</em> doesn’t work… maybe this is a doomed enterprise.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Maybe. With the qualification that I don’t like the word <em>any</em>. But yeah—for this architecture.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> “Any” is hard.<br> Maybe God or the angels, Andrey. The angels can’t lie.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> The theorem provers in the sky.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That’s a good note to leave our audience with.</p><p><strong>Andrey:</strong> Yeah.</p><p>Please like, share, and subscribe.<br> You guys are the most handsome, beautiful group of podcast listeners I’ve ever encountered.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> And the most intelligent.
